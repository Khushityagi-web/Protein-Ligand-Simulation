## Recentered and rewrapped trajectory with GROMACS trjconv
# Used `gmx trjconv` to recenter and rewrap the simulation trajectory.
# Recentering ensures the molecule of interest (e.g., protein) is at the center of the box.
# Rewrapped coordinates ensure whole molecules are intact under periodic boundary conditions.
# Output trajectory saved as MD_center.xtc for further analysis or visualization.
  gmx trjconv -s MD.tpr -f MD.xtc -o MD_center.xtc -center -pbc mol -ur compact (command)
Select group for centering:
1  (Group 1 (Protein) has  4918 elements)
Select group for output:
0      (Group 0 (System) has 46817 elements)

## Performed RMSD calculations for MD trajectory
# Calculated the RMSD of atomic positions from the reference structure using GROMACS.
# Input trajectory (MD_center.xtc) was compared to the reference structure (MD.tpr).
# Generated RMSD data output (rmsd.xvg) for plotting and analysis.
  gmx rms -s MD.tpr -f MD_center.xtc -o rmsd.xvg  (command)
Select group for least squares fit:
1  (Group 1 (Protein) has  4918 elements)
Select group for RMSD calculation:
13   (Group 13 (LIG) has 52 elements)

## Visualize RMSD over time using xmgrace
# Used xmgrace to generate a graphical plot from the rmsd.xvg file.
# The plot shows RMSD variations during the simulation to evaluate system stability and structural changes.
xmgrace rmsd.xvg  (command)
xmgrace -hardcopy -hdevice EPS rmsd.xvg  (command)
 epstopdf rmsd.eps  (command)

## Added script for RMSF calculation using GROMACS. 
# The command computes residue/atom fluctuations from their average positions based on the MD trajectory. 
# Input files include `MD.tpr` for topology and `MD_center.xtc` for the centered trajectory. 
# Output is saved as `rmsf.xvg`, providing a per-atom or per-residue RMSF profile. 
# Useful for assessing flexibility or stability of specific regions during simulation.
gmx rmsf -s MD.tpr -f MD_center.xtc -o rmsf.xvg  (command)
Select a group:
13  (Groupv13 (LIG) has 52 elements)

## Added visualization step for RMSF analysis using XMGrace. 
# The `rmsf.xvg` file, containing RMSF data (atom/residue index vs. fluctuation), is plotted to assess the flexibility of specific regions. 
# This step provides a clear graphical representation to interpret simulation results effectively.
xmgrace rmsf.xvg  (command)
xmgrace -hardcopy -hdevice EPS rmsf.xvg  (command)
epstopdf rmsf.eps  (command)

# Analyzed hydrogen bonds in MD trajectory using gmx hbond; results saved in hb.xvg with time units in nanoseconds.
gmx hbond -s MD.tpr -f MD_center.xtc -num hb.xvg -tu ns  (command)
Specify 2 groups to analyze:
1    (Group 1 (Protein) has  4918 elements)
13   (Group    13 ( LIG) has 52 elements)
xmgrace hb.xvg  (Plotted hydrogen bond analysis results (hb.xvg) using XMGrace for visual inspection of hydrogen bond dynamics over time.)
xmgrace -hardcopy -hdevice EPS hb.xvg  (command)
epstopdf hb.eps  (command)

## Added command for calculating the radius of gyration using GROMACS to analyze MD simulation results
gmx gyrate -s MD.tpr -f MD_center.xtc -o gyrate1.xvg  (command)
Select a group:
1    (Group 1 : Protein)
xmgrace gyrate1.xvg  (Used xmgrace to visualize the radius of gyration data from gyrate1.xvg)
xmgrace -hardcopy -hdevice EPS gyrate1.xvg (command)
epstopdf gyrate1.eps  (command)

## Extracted energy components from MD simulation using gmx energy and saved results to energy1.xvg for analysis
gmx energy -f MD.edr -o energy1.xvg  (command)
Select the terms you want from the following list by:
48  (# Selected T-Protein_LIG (48) to analyze the protein-ligand complex in the simulation)
xmgrace -nxy energy1.xvg  (# Visualized energy data from energy1.xvg using xmgrace with an XY plot format)
xmgrace -hardcopy -hdevice EPS energy1.xvg  (command)
epstopdf energy1.eps  (command)
